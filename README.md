# celeste_mod_e
a celeste mod that adds crystals (like the dash refills) to change the direction of falling blocks.

be warned, this is the spaghettiest code ever.
i recommend going to a therapist after looking through the code.

i didnt write most of it myself, it was mostly copied from dnspy decompiler.

# Why is it called that?
i didnt know what to name it when i created the project and i couldnt be bothered to change it

will be named Fall Helper (name by MewJohto)
